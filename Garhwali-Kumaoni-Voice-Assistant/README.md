# Garhwali-Kumaoni-Voice-Assistant
Problem Definition & Research Analysis

1. Background
Garhwali and Kumaoni are widely spoken regional languages in Uttarakhand, especially among elderly people and rural communities. However, most digital platforms and AI systems are designed for Hindi or English users, resulting in limited accessibility for native regional language speakers.
This mismatch creates communication barriers for both local residents and tourists, particularly in voice-based interactions.

2. Problem Statement
Garhwali and Kumaoni speakers face difficulty using modern digital services due to the absence of native language support. Existing voice assistants and translation tools do not recognize these languages, making technology less accessible for elderly users and ineffective for tourists interacting in rural or hill regions.
There is a need for a simple, voice-enabled system that can understand Garhwali and Kumaoni inputs and translate them into Hindi or English.

3. Existing Solutions vs Gaps
|Solution	                | Regional Language Support	    |    Limitation             |
|Google Translate	        |      NO	                    | No Garhwali/Kumaoni       |
|Hindi Voice Assistants	    |      NO	                    | Excludes native speakers  |
|Phrasebooks	            |   Limited	                    | Static, no voice          |
|Tourist Apps	            |     NO	                    | Major languages only      |

Gap Identified:
No voice-first, AI-based solution exists for Garhwali and Kumaoni.

4. Why the Proposed Solution is Better
The proposed system directly addresses gaps left by existing tools:
|Criteria	                | Existing Tools	    |  Proposed Solution   |
|Regional language focus	|    no                 |       Yes            |
|Voice-first interaction	|     no                |       Yes            |
|Elderly usability	        |    Low	            |       High           |
|Tourist relevance	        |   Limited             |     	High           |
|Adaptability via AI	    |   Limited             |    	Planned        |

Key Advantage:
The solution is region-specific, voice-centric, and inclusive

2.	Technical Flow/Architecture

The system follows a clean and modular architecture that ensures smooth data flow and easy upgrades.

Architecture Flow:
 
User Input (Voice/Text)
        ↓
